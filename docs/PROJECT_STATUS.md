# Project status and restart guide

Snapshot: 2026-09-11. Reviewed main:
[7e517af](https://github.com/Closer24/Universe24/commit/7e517afb7a274821de05bf247ece91827c1b030b).
This is an orientation snapshot, not a live dashboard or a test result.
Refresh it when the default model, major integration state or restart procedure
changes; daily task detail belongs in Issues and PRs.

## What this checkout contains

The active package is [event_universe](../src/event_universe/). The ordinary
`Simulation` defaults to `scalar-field-v10-contact`; link, balanced-motion,
collision and causal-stream choices remain explicit alternatives. Check
[api.py](../src/event_universe/api.py) and the selected model, not an old chat.
Their physics contracts and limitations are in
[SIMULATOR_DEFINITIONS.md](../SIMULATOR_DEFINITIONS.md).

Use the default interpreter in [.python-version](../.python-version) with the
project environment described in [README.md](../README.md#install-and-run).
The package's minimum required Python version is separately declared in
[pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml); it does not select the runtime for a shell.

The generic delivered-face/conservative-field work, unit-link matter ownership
and Computational Field display rename are tracked in
[PR #19](https://github.com/Closer24/Universe24/pull/19).
It was closed without merge on 2026-09-11 at head
`e69a77fee97dcbb385cb2565240fafdd6b6a6179` and is not included in the reviewed main.
Its acceptance evidence and blockers belong
in that PR; do not infer that it is ready from this navigation document.

## Specifications and gaps

[Universe 24 Highlights](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IkhSyqZZMBSgbJV-PMMwcXG0D_Rlfg4FrLy2jXBMUSs/edit)
is the user's high-level specification. Its requirements are not automatically
implemented: the generic Vector/Face/Transport target must not be confused with
the baseline scalar engine. Read relevant current sections for specification work.
Keep accepted executable contracts in the repository and record source revision
or retrieval date in the related PR. Resolve differences explicitly; do not
overwrite the baseline to make a description appear true.

Software validation and physical acceptance are separate. In particular, the
[isolated-motion rejection contract](../SIMULATOR_DEFINITIONS.md#reject-isolated-self-force-in-application-runs)
detects a baseline failure; a passing detector test does not fix that law.

## Resume without a conversation

1. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); inspect checkout status, current main and
   [open PRs](https://github.com/Closer24/Universe24/pulls).
2. Resolve the task from its [Issue](https://github.com/Closer24/Universe24/issues)
   or user request. Record the intended model, base, owned files and acceptance.
3. Install and run using [README.md](../README.md#install-and-run). Use a new
   output directory so previous experiment evidence is not overwritten.
4. Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Run the required gate and attach
   actual results for the submitted tree, including not-run checks and failures.
5. Hand off through [skills/workflow.md](../skills/workflow.md), then verify any
   authorized integration against current GitHub state.

If GitHub or Highlights cannot be read, say which information is unavailable.
Do not claim the snapshot is current. Work within verified local contracts where
the task permits; stop for clarification when a missing decision affects the law.
