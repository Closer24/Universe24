# Configured outward spatial fields

These optional candidates separate a carried disturbance from the spatial fields
it emits. Select fields through `spatial_fields` in initialization. Schema version
1 selects `conservative-outward-v1`, with conservative transport and unlimited
declared emission; its example is
[moving_source.json](../examples/moving_source.json). Schema version 2 selects
`finite-dissipative-v1`, requiring finite decay and source allowances; its example
is [finite_fields.json](../examples/finite_fields.json). Names such as `radiation`,
`strength` and `heading` remain configuration data. The runner derives the policy
from `schema_version`, never from words in the user's `model_id`.

Schema 1 also offers opt-in `"transport": "local"` fields through
[LOCAL_FIELD_RULES.md](LOCAL_FIELD_RULES.md). They retain dynamic stock and use
configured six-port output assignments instead of outward octant splitting.
Local and outward fields can coexist. The sections below describe the outward
candidate; the linked contract owns the local mode, field groups, multi-field
rules and transformation accounting. Schema 2 remains unchanged.

## Local state and propagation

Each spatial field references an existing scalar/vector field definition, with
its units, scale, sign, extensivity and `conserved` flag. Each materialized node
has eight octant populations, bounded allocation phases and six delivered
directional samples. All payloads use positive integer encoding. These are
independent of the disturbance slots; there are no source IDs or histories.

Octants are `+++`, `++-`, `+-+`, `+--`, `-++`, `-+-`, `--+`, `---`. An octant
splits only among its three sign-compatible cardinal directions. Each hop
therefore increases unwrapped Manhattan distance from its emission point by
one. Sideways branches cannot reverse an octant's signs. Travel through +X
enters the next node through -X while remaining +X travel; the face does not
negate the payload. Periodic boundary return is a separate effect.

The six delivered samples are a projection of inventory, never extra stock.
Counterflows remain separate even if their resultant is zero. A vector payload
travels component by component, independently of the carrying port. Preserving
scalar stock does not automatically preserve vector momentum or energy.

Every populated channel crosses one link per `link_ticks` interval. All integer
units leave immediately; bounded rotating phases allocate indivisible units
without losing quantity or waiting to accumulate a larger packet. The phase is
allocation bookkeeping, not missing physical stock. Splitting itself preserves
every component. Schema 1 dilutes only through redistribution; schema 2 also
applies the explicit completed-link decay below. Neither law uses a global radius
or imposed inverse-square factor. The lattice rule does not promise uniform shell
intensity or Euclidean isotropy.

## Initialization

This fragment uses schema version 1:

```json
"spatial_fields": [{
  "field": "radiation", "baseline": 0, "transport": "outward",
  "axis_weights": [1, 1, 1],
  "octant_weights": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}],
"emissions": [{
  "type": "carrier", "field": "radiation",
  "amount": {"field": "strength"}, "denominator": 1, "source": true
}]
```

`baseline` is immutable local background, zero when omitted. Untouched nodes
return it without creating active records. Only deviations propagate. The local
value is baseline plus resident populations. Diagnostics count baseline once
per lattice node, not once per materialized sparse record.

`axis_weights` contains three nonnegative integers with a positive bounded sum;
`octant_weights` contains eight. Both default to equal weights. They select
branches within each octant and distribute total emission among octants.

Emission expressions read only their resident record's owned fields. The
numerator divided by `denominator` is an amount per propagation interval,
not per carrier movement or per elementary tick when `link_ticks > 1`.
Sources waiting for a frozen movement proposal continue to emit. A record
wholly in a link is not a second resident source. Emission preserves carried
source strength: required `source: true` declares external injection. A
reservoir-funded source needs a separately defined atomic debit law.

For schema version 2, every spatial-field entry additionally requires
`"decay": {"retain_numerator": 2, "retain_denominator": 3}` and every emission
requires `"budget": 216`, or a three-element array for a vector target. Budgets
are nonnegative component amounts in the target field's configured units,
bounded by `1_073_741_823`. A zero component budget is valid. Schema 1 rejects
both new keys, and schema 2 rejects their omission. Schema 2 without any spatial
fields is valid.

Each matching initial record receives its own budget for each emission rule.
At an interval, signed division first produces the requested whole amount and
fraction. The emitted component is that whole amount, limited in magnitude by
its remaining allowance; the allowance decreases by the absolute amount actually
emitted. Reversing the source sign cannot refund earlier use. Unfulfilled demand
is discarded rather than carried as debt, and an exhausted component clears its
fraction. An entirely exhausted rule does not evaluate its expression again.
This allowance limits external injection; it is not a mass, energy or other
physical reservoir, and is not included in field inventory.

Fractional emission remainders and source allocation phases belong to each
emitting record, together with finite remaining allowances in schema 2. They
travel with it and survive waiting. An older frozen movement proposal cannot
overwrite newer emission metadata. These are fixed registers per configured
rule, not a growing source history. Emission requires whole-record hold or move
transport, so splitting cannot duplicate an allowance.

An optional initial pulse supplies eight populations:

```json
"spatial_seeds": [{
  "position": [15, 15, 15], "field": "radiation",
  "populations": [27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27, 27]
}]
```

This contains 216 units. Under schema 1 with equal weights, each axial neighbor
receives 36 after one interval. After two intervals the origin is empty and all
stock lies at Manhattan distance two. Schema 2 additionally attenuates the
delivered populations as specified below. For vector fields each entry is an integer triple.
Spatial fields must be extensive. Unsupported laws, wrong shapes, nonintegral
values, duplicate seeds and unknown keys are rejected.

## Finite completed-link decay

Schema 2 requires integer parameters `0 <= p < q <= 1_073_741_823`, with
`p = retain_numerator` and `q = retain_denominator`. On completing a link with an
interior receiving node, each original packet's octant component `v` becomes:

```text
retained = sign(v) * floor(abs(v) * p / q)
dissipated = v - retained
```

This operates before packets are merged at the destination. For example, two
separate incoming components of 1 with `p/q = 1/2` both disappear; merging them
first and retaining 1 would implement a different law. The six delivered samples
are built from the attenuated arrivals. Resident seeds and newly committed
reactions first traverse a full link before this loss is applied. There is no
loss merely because a carrier waits or a diagnostic reads a node.

No decay remainder is retained. This is an explicit dissipative integer law,
not conservation-preserving division. The immutable baseline is exempt and
persists even after all dynamic populations vanish. Each component retains its
own sign until it becomes zero, but component-wise rounding can change a vector's
direction and norm. It does not conserve physical momentum or energy. Exact
opposite reactions at coupling commit remain a separate local property.

Every nonzero integer component loses magnitude on each completed interior link
or leaves the domain through an open boundary. For a
fixed finite set of initial records, initial populations and finite source and
coupling budgets, total absolute dynamic injection is bounded. Once the last
nonzero input has occurred, all dynamic spatial populations therefore disappear
after finitely many links, including on the periodic lattice. This does not
promise that carriers stop moving or that unused allowances reach zero, nor a
universal extinction tick independent of the source schedule. Allocation phases
may remain in sparse nodes after their physical stock vanishes.

## Event order and cost

At interval start `t`, each active node evaluates resident sources and combines
them with its owned octants. It validates the complete local proposal, moves
ownership into six fixed link packets and records injection. Delivery occurs
at `t + link_ticks`. In schema 2, decay is evaluated separately on each packet
reaching an interior receiver before validating the combined destination and
clearing packet ownership.
No received influence crosses another link in the same event.

The configured `boundary` applies to fields and carriers alike. `periodic` wraps
across every positive and negative axis face without changing the packet port or
octant label. `open` sends a terminal packet out of the simulation after the same
full link time. Its original signed populations become escaped quantity; they
are not decayed, merged or sampled outside because no exterior receiver exists.
A baseline never enters a packet or the escaped ledger. See
[the boundary contract](DISTURBANCES.md#domain-boundary).

By default the candidate has a separate fixed field clock. Priced spatial work contributes
to a new carrier cycle at the same node and interval; spatial forwarding itself
does not wait for the carrier. Thus `normal_budget` controls carrier delay and
does not bound the field stage's throughput. This is an explicit change from
the old single uniform-delay stage, supported by the requested fixed-c field.
Configurations without spatial fields retain the old timing contract.

Set `spatial_computation_delay: true` for the alternative
[shared field/carrier clock](SPATIAL_COMPUTATION_DELAY.md). In that mode all
local work determines one wait, emission happens at commit, and later input is
retained separately. The following fixed-clock scheduling details describe the
default mode; receipt decay and integer inventory rules apply to both modes.

Every field operation, including receipt and configured decay, has a price.
Completed-link decay cost is accumulated at the receiving node and charged once
in its next spatial cycle, alongside receipt and merge work. This does not change
link speed. Inactive empty nodes retain their allocation phases without repeatedly
charging old field work.

The host scheduler indexes nodes with field work or one pending cleanup phase,
plus resident emitters and spatially coupled carriers. A known idle node retains
its octant allocation phases and zero cost without a full history scan. New
arrivals and committed reactions reactivate their local node. An idle node's
empty-phase timestamp is resolved from the field clock when accessed; a newly
created node is never backdated. This is host bookkeeping, not a skipped physical
tick or a changed delay. Inventory diagnostics may use this index because idle
nodes own no dynamic populations. Neither the index nor measured totals supplies
values to a field law.
A previously frozen carrier proposal retains its original physical values and
cost; later field activity does not create computation debt. Carriers within
the normal budget move every interval, without an arbitrary extra wait.

## Accounting and output

Each conservative local split satisfies old inventory plus injection equals
outgoing inventory. Read-only totals include baseline, spatial stock, waiting
carrier originals and all in-flight packets once. The component-wise balances are:

```text
schema 1: final = initial + committed sources - escaped
schema 2: final = initial + committed sources - committed dissipation - escaped
```

Dissipation is a signed loss
ledger: removing a negative component records a negative loss. A `conserved`
declaration still requires exact accounting; schema 2 explicitly includes this
loss and does not promise constant physical totals.

Runs remain headless by default. `state.json` separates disturbances, spatial
baselines, octants, directional samples and packets. Events record field costs,
injection, sends, receipts and committed decay. Source/configuration fingerprints,
the selected schema policy and per-tick balance checks cover the combined world.

Records with carried source or exchange state also expose a decoded
`bookkeeping` section in snapshots, in configured rule order. These fractions
and allocation phases are not additional conserved field stock. Remaining
emission and coupling allowances are also exposed separately from inventory.

## Response and self interaction

Outward propagation does not establish that a source always arrives before its
own field. Both can traverse the same link together. A turn can collect earlier
contributions along multiple paths; a periodic boundary can return old field.
Merged integer allocation is not generally source-linear. Automatic self
subtraction is not enabled by this extension. Unknown self-filter settings fail
instead of being silently ignored. Two explicit opt-in policies change when a
carrier samples relative to its own emission without identifying sources:
[`field_phase_first`](SPATIAL_COUPLINGS.md#field-phase-first-ordering) and
[`arrival_port_blind`](SPATIAL_COUPLINGS.md#arrival-port-blind-sampling).
Optional [spatial couplings](SPATIAL_COUPLINGS.md)
now provide generic exchange and exact discrete rotation with a local opposite
field reaction. Their straight-line flux response has a restricted geometric
self-interaction guarantee; it does not claim general source attribution.
Existing explicit paired-record couplings remain available independently.

A future self filter must provide a bounded local attribution law and pass both
isolated-source and external-source controls. Shadow worlds, source histories
and global isolation checks may be diagnostic references only, never physical
inputs. The transport candidate does not establish a general force law.
