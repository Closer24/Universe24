# The algebra of the law, in one place: the objects, the ring and the six operations, the click-to-click algebra, the exact identities, what is reached under named hypotheses, what each FAIL row lacks, and how the group was reached (the canonical statement; the Algebra Unifier, 2026-09-23)

The model owner's word of 2026-09-23 ([record 1128](LOG_2026-09-20.md),
the Boss's translation: "It is simply all the algebra; let us unify it
into one place; no need for several files there, if it works out") and
the Boss's judgement that it works out as one document: this file is
the one canonical statement of the algebra of the law, in the order
the paper takes ([record 1099](LOG_2026-09-20.md): the algebra first,
then what follows from it, the way, how the group was reached, the
comparison). Every rule is stated here once; every other file of the
tree that states a rule of the algebra is kept as the record of its
day and carries a header pointing here (the one-source rule of
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); nothing deleted). The plan of this file,
its source map (which paragraph is taken from which file and section)
and the list of the places where two sources stated one rule
differently are [docs/designs/algebra_one/PLAN.md](designs/algebra_one/PLAN.md);
this file proves nothing anew: each statement carries the link to its
proof in its owning file, and no formula is stated that a source does
not state.

**The rules this file obeys.** Every symbol is named in English at its
first use; a scalar plain, a vector bold lowercase (**p**), a matrix or
an operator bold uppercase (**F**). Every number carries its kind:
DETECTOR (a click or a count of clicks at a declared detector, the
only kind compared with nature or pinned), GAMEBOARD (the host's view
of the board, a diagnostic, compared with nothing), COMPUTATION (the
algebra's closed form, no run), HOST (a cost or a time of the machine),
CONVERSION (an Outside number made from counts by a named reading).
Every result is stated as matching nature, never as how nature is;
Newton's, Einstein's, Lorentz's, Bohr's and Balmer's forms appear only
as the thing compared with. The group is called the group of order 24
everywhere (the rotation group of the cube, isomorphic to S_4, the
symmetric group on four things; never "S24"; the owner's word of
[record 1114](LOG_2026-09-20.md), Highlights 5.4). Where two sources
worded one rule differently, the wording in force is stated with the
record or the code that decides it, and the superseded wording is
named once with its source, so that the reader finds both.

**The symbols, named once.** N the phase circle's grain (the paper's
N_phi; 64 on the register, 1024 and 4096 on the Bell worlds); Z_N the
integers modulo N, the phase circle; Z[Z_N] its integer group ring; f a
record's rows at a Node as one element of Z[Z_N], f = sum over p of f_p
x^p with x one phase step and f_p the amount at the phase p; zeta_N the
primitive N-th root of unity, exp(2 pi i / N); Z[zeta_N] the cyclotomic
integers; ev the evaluation Z[Z_N] -> Z[zeta_N]; C and S the tables of
the cosine and the sine at the scale 256, **E** the 2 x N integer matrix
whose rows they are, **G** = **E**^T **E** the click's Gram matrix; **F**
the interval's map on the state vector **s** with its rate vector **r**
and wall d per component; Q the label's scale (the paper's N_l, 64);
S_w the push's width (the paper's N_w, the world key `width`); M a
body's content in units of its family's quantum; T_D the flight period
of a direction D and S_1 = abs(D)_1 its Manhattan length; c the pace of
a light row, 1 / sqrt 3 Links per interval in the limit of every
direction, 32 / 55 on a heading; v a pace in Links per interval; k the
whole number of intervals per hop of a moving record, v = 1 / k; r a
detector's own count per interval against the tick, the click theorem's
one free number; k_AB and k_BA the two one-way count ratios of the
click theorem; gamma the Lorentz factor 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2), as the
thing compared with; h the action per Link of a row's phase turn (the
world key `action`); n / d the suspension pair (the world key
`suspension`); a_tau the age moment a wall reads; k_crowd = a_tau n / d
the crowd's stretch of a count (the FAIL rows file writes it k; here k
is the hop's whole number, so the crowd's stretch carries its
subscript); gamma_PPN the world key `optical`'s declared strength;
c_f = 1 + gamma_PPN the flight's coefficient in the age wall's set; u
the birth wheel's value written on a record; (A1), (A2), (A3) the
hypotheses of chapter 5, defined at its head.

## 1. The objects: the four group objects, their definitions in symbols, the dictionary, and how the group was reached (the chief physicist's page, carried over)

This chapter is the chief physicist's page
[docs/GROUP_STRUCTURE.md](GROUP_STRUCTURE.md) (merged to main at
`7739bbbe`, PR #968), its sections 1 to 6 carried over verbatim below
with his name and its date (2026-09-23); his sections 7 to 11 (the
collision as a group action, the operations between the objects, how
the 48 act as one table, where each definition lives, every naming of
24 and 48 in the tree) stay in his file as the index and the record
this chapter links to. Nothing here is a second definition.

**The owner's road, first** ([record 1136](LOG_2026-09-20.md), the
page's section 3 in one sentence): the operations came first, as acts
on the board (a row flies one Link per interval, rows meet at a Node, a
body steps by an accumulator against a wall, a phase turns, identical
rows merge, a detector clicks); the 48 are everything that preserves a
Node of six Ports and its cone of one Link per interval; requiring
every rule to commute with them chooses the admissible forms; and the
group of order 24 is the part under which the hand is kept as well.

*(Carried over verbatim from `docs/GROUP_STRUCTURE.md` sections 1 to 6, the chief
physicist, 2026-09-23; the section numbers inside the text, "section 8" and
the like, are that page's own and point into it.)*

### 1.1 The definitions, in symbols

The model owner's second word (2026-09-23): the mathematics itself, not
an index; what the group is, what its operations are, what the cube is,
in the definition of the system. Every symbol named at its first use.

- **The object ("the cube").** P = {+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z}, the six
  Ports of a Node, with the involution e -> -e (the opposite Port); the
  lattice Z^3 with the L1 neighbourhood, six neighbours per Node. The six
  Ports are the face centres of a cube (the vertices of an octahedron);
  no solid is meant. This is the one choice of the model.
- **The symmetry group of the cube.** G_48 = { g : P -> P, a bijection
  with g(-e) = -g(e) for every Port e }, the operation the composition
  ("g then h", `compose_symmetries`), the identity the map that fixes
  every Port, the inverse the map that undoes g. Equivalently the signed
  permutation matrices: the 3 x 3 integer matrices **M**_g with one entry
  +1 or -1 in every row and column and 0 elsewhere, under matrix
  multiplication; G_48 = {+1, -1}^3 semidirect S_3 (S_3 the symmetric
  group on the three axes), the hyperoctahedral group B_3, the full
  octahedral group O_h; the order 3! x 2^3 = 48. The determinant det:
  G_48 -> {+1, -1}, det(gh) = det(g) det(h), is a homomorphism
  (`symmetry_hand`: the sign of the axis permutation times the product of
  the axis signs).
- **The group of order 24.** G_24 = ker det = { g : det(g) = +1 }, a
  subgroup of index 2, the rotations. It acts faithfully on the cube's
  four body diagonals, so G_24 is isomorphic to S_4, the symmetric group
  on four things (the paper's Theorem 1). The other coset, det(g) = -1,
  is the 24 reflections; a pseudoscalar h transforms as h -> det(g) h and
  tells the cosets apart. The order 24 is |G_24|; the group is S_4, never
  S_24.
- **The action of G_48 on the state.** On a vector **v** in Z^3 by
  g . **v** = **M**_g **v**; on the direction table D (a finite set of
  primitive integer vectors closed under the 48, a G_48-set); on the
  labels exactly, **u**_{gD} = g **u**_D; on the Nodes about a centre by
  the same matrix; trivially on every scalar (a content, an amount, a
  count, an age); not at all on a phase (a phase is not a direction). The
  law's claim, tested and not counted: every operation V of the law
  commutes with every g, V(g . s) = g . V(s) on the state s, up to the two
  declared ties (the digital line's axis order, the collision's Port
  order).
- **The phase circle and its group ring.** Z_N = Z / N Z, the integers
  modulo N under addition, N per world. Z[Z_N] = { sum over p of a_p [p]
  : a_p in Z }, the integer group ring: addition by components, the
  product [p] [q] = [p + q]. A record's rows at a Node are one element of
  Z[Z_N]; the merge is the addition; the cancel [p + N/2] = -[p] is the
  passage to the quotient ring Z[Z_N] / (x^(N/2) + 1) = Z[zeta_N], the
  cyclotomic integers, zeta_N a primitive N-th root of unity; the click is
  the evaluation ev([p]) = (C[p], S[p]), the tables' integer vector near
  256 zeta_N^p, and the click's weight the norm |z|^2.
- **The translation group.** Z_X x Z_Y x Z_Z, acting on the Nodes by
  addition modulo the extent on a periodic axis and up to the face on an
  open axis (the face a detector).
- **The collision.** A cyclic group Z_m acting on the finite set S of the
  3^8 slot states of a Node by the shift sigma (`CollisionTable.act`); the
  orbits of the action are the classes; the invariants (the crowd mask,
  the number of singles, their headings' sum) are constant on an orbit;
  the period of a state is the size of its orbit.
- **The state and the operator.** A Node's state: its rows (per family
  and direction an element of Z[Z_N] with an amount and a content) and its
  bodies (the content per family in Z^F, F the number of families, the
  momentum **p** in Z^3, the phase in Z_N, the age in Z, the counts as a
  point of Z^n / d Z^n). The law is one operator per interval at every
  Node, composed of the six operations of section 8 alone: (T) the
  translation, (B) the bilinear form, (G) the group-ring addition, (P) a
  permutation of the joint state, (E) the evaluation, (D) the division
  with the remainder kept and the comparison. G_48 acts on the whole
  state space through the directions and the Nodes and commutes with each
  of the six.

### 1.2 From the algebra to the physics: the dictionary

The model owner's third word (2026-09-23): how the algebra enters the
physics, where momentum, mass and the rest come from; what is the
definition of the mathematics and what is the definition of the physics.
The mathematics is section 1: the state space, the six operations and
the groups. The physics is two things and no third: the names given to
the elements of that structure (this table, one line each, the full
statement in the owner document) and the reading rule (section 8). Every
number of nature is reached from the structure under these names or is a
declared input ([FULL_PICTURE.md](FULL_PICTURE.md) section 1;
[HIGHLIGHTS.md](HIGHLIGHTS.md) 5.7, the conversions and the inputs).

### 1.3 How the group was reached from the operations

The model owner's fourth word (2026-09-23): we came from the physics to
the algebra, when we saw which operations the GameBoard has to perform;
so what links the physical operations to the group? The order of events
is recorded in
[designs/algebra_transition/HISTORY.md](designs/algebra_transition/HISTORY.md)
section 18 (the vector program, records 180, 183, 186, 191 and 231 of
the log); the link is one requirement, that every rule commute with
every symmetry of the neighbourhood it reads.

1. **The operations came first**, as acts on the board: a row flies one
   Link per interval along its direction (locality and straightness),
   rows meet at a Node (the collision), a body steps by an accumulator
   against a wall, a phase turns, identical rows merge, a detector
   clicks. On 2026-09-21 the owner said "proceed with everything
   represented in vectors and matrices, from group theory" (record 191),
   and each rule was written as one of the six operations of section 8 on
   a state vector.
2. **The group is the answer to "which maps preserve what the operations
   act on".** They act on a Node with six Ports and its Links, and on a
   causal cone of one Link per interval. The bijections of the six Ports
   that keep opposite Ports opposite are the signed permutations of the
   axes, 48 of them; and over the integers the only bijections that
   preserve the cone are these 48 (the click frame,
   [designs/click_frame/DERIVATION.md](designs/click_frame/DERIVATION.md),
   the proof sketch (a)): a boost is not Z-linear, so no boost is among
   them, and Lorentz's form is reached Outside from the clicks, not as a
   symmetry of the lattice.
3. **Where the 48 first appeared in the code, before they were named a
   group: the collision.** The collision table is generated from its rule
   over the classes of slot states, and the test enumerated the 48 maps
   that leave the table as it is; the group was found as the invariance
   of one physical operation and then recognised as the symmetry of all
   of them (BEAM_LAW note 42: "the same 48 maps the collision test
   enumerated"; `tests/test_nature_beam_collision.py` (b)).
4. **The 24 came from the hand.** Carrying spin and polarisation
   (hand-v1, record 128) needed a pseudoscalar, a quantity a reflection
   flips and a rotation keeps; that is det(g), and it splits the 48 into
   the 24 rotations that keep the hand and the 24 reflections that flip
   it. The owner's word on the name (record 231): the 24 are the
   octahedron's 24 rotations, not his numeral.
5. **The other objects the same way.** The step and the flight are
   shifts, hence the translation group of the torus; the turn adds
   modulo N, hence Z_N, and the merge of records is addition in Z[Z_N];
   the collision is a permutation of a finite set generated by a shift,
   hence a cyclic action. And c was not chosen: it is the norm of the
   flight operator, 1 / sqrt 3, from locality and straightness (record
   186).
6. **What the group does back to the physics: it forces forms.** A rule
   that reads only the local state must commute with the 48, and that
   constraint selects the admissible forms. The proven instance
   ([designs/open_problems/lorentz/NOTE.md](designs/open_problems/lorentz/NOTE.md)
   section 4, Theorem 3): an isotropic even reading of a body's momentum
   within the six operations is a bilinear form **p**^T **M** **p** with
   **M** commuting with all 48; the symmetric integer matrices fixed by
   the 48 are the multiples of the identity, so the only such reading is
   c **p** . **p**, and the square m^2 + 3 **p** . **p** follows. "Generic"
   in the three tests of every rule (generic, vector, local) means
   exactly this: commuting with the 48, made of the six operations,
   reading the neighbourhood alone.

In one sentence: the operations did not deduce a group; they were
defined on a Node of six Ports, the 48 are everything that preserves that
Node and its cone, and once every rule is required to commute with them
they choose the admissible forms, the group of order 24 being the part
under which the hand is kept as well.

### 1.4 The names, fixed by the owner

The names are the model owner's (2026-09-23,
[record 1114](LOG_2026-09-20.md#1114-the-owner-the-algebraist-should-also-understand-why-the-passed-experiments-passed-and-everywhere-the-group-is-called-the-group-of-order-24-the-definition-too-2026-09-23-0915z-recorded-by-the-boss-at-0915z-the-owner-001xz-in-hebrew-the-bosss-translation-what-will-also-help-the-algebraist-is-to-understand-why-the-experiments-that-passed-passed-and-the-ones-that-failed-failed-and-what-was-missing-in-them-according-to-what-is-derived-from-the-algebra-to-physics-he-understands-it-since-he-derived-the-algebra-and-reached-the-physics-be-strict-about-it-in-item-5-the-opening-everywhere-we-call-it-the-group-of-the-24-that-is-the-correct-thing-to-say-algebraically-so-it-is-needed-in-the-definition-as-well-say-that-it-is-correct-to-say-the-group-of-the-24-the-bosss-answer-yes-the-group-of-order-24-the-rotation-group-of-the-cube-isomorphic-to-s4-theorem-1-is-the-correct-algebraic-name-and-the-models-name-the-48-signed-permutations-of-the-axes-are-the-objects-symmetries-whose-rotations-that-group-is-named-once-where-the-hand-tells-the-cosets-read-acs-line-the-paper-says-the-group-of-order-24-uniformly-in-the-abstract-the-opening-theorem-1s-statement-and-definition-the-families-section-and-the-discussion-the-other-names-in-apposition-once-each-where-the-isomorphism-is-stated-the-writer-ordered-so-with-the-central-ideas-sentence-or-one-more-commit-on-paper-opening-every-occurrence-listed-in-planmd-the-fail-rows-algebraist-ordered-one-more-table-every-pass-measured-partly-and-replicated-row-of-table-2-one-line-each-why-it-passed-by-the-algebra-which-click-counts-or-count-ratios-which-declared-integers-which-theorem-or-identity-of-the-ring-whether-anything-measured-inside-the-board-so-each-fails-lack-is-seen-against-the-passes-chain-with-one-thing-missing-named-the-naming-decision-to-highlights-54-as-one-line),
[Highlights 5.4](HIGHLIGHTS.md)):

- **The symmetry group of the cube**: the 48 signed permutations of the
  three axes (an axis permutation and a sign per axis, 3! x 2^3 = 48), the
  full octahedral group O_h, each element written as its image of the six
  Ports [+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z] and sending opposite Ports to opposite
  Ports. In the code `core.game_board.cube_symmetries`, with the
  composition `compose_symmetries`, the identity `IDENTITY_SYMMETRY` and
  the inverse `inverse_symmetry`; its pseudoscalar `symmetry_hand`, the
  sign of the axis permutation times the product of the axis signs (the
  determinant of the signed permutation matrix), +1 on 24 elements and -1
  on 24.
- **The group of order 24**: the kernel of that determinant, the
  index-2 subgroup of rotations, called everywhere "the group of order
  24" (the rotation group of the cube, isomorphic to the symmetric group
  S_4 on the cube's four body diagonals; the paper's Theorem 1, "the 24 of
  the name", `paper/general_formula/main.tex`). The other coset, the 24
  reflections, is told from it by the hand, an axial vector or any
  pseudoscalar.
- **"S24" is not a name of anything here.** The 24 is the order of the
  group; the symmetric group it is isomorphic to is S_4, of order 24, not
  S_24 (which has order 24!). No file of the repository uses "S24" or
  "S_24" (section 11).
- **The 48 are not chosen.** The one choice is the six Ports of a Node
  (the L1 neighbourhood of the cubic lattice); every map that preserves
  the six Ports as a set and the lattice's Links is one of the 48 and every
  one of the 48 does ([FULL_PICTURE.md](FULL_PICTURE.md) section 1, "What
  is not chosen: the group of 48"; the crystallographic restriction: no
  three-dimensional lattice has a larger point group).

### 1.5 The phase circle and its group ring

- **The phase circle Z_N**: the integers modulo N, the cyclic group of the
  phase, N chosen per world (64 on the register; 1024 and 4096 on the Bell
  worlds). A turn adds, a difference subtracts, the opposite phase is half
  a turn away; with it the unit vectors (C[phase], S[phase]) at the scale
  256, a declared rounding. In the code `core.phase.PhaseCircle` (`turn`,
  `difference`, `opposite`, `vector`); named in
  [BEAM_LAW note 42](BEAM_LAW.md#10-implementation-notes-2026-09-19-the-implementation);
  the properties in `tests/test_group_structure.py`
  (`test_the_phase_circle_is_the_cyclic_group_with_unit_vectors`).
- **The group ring Z[Z_N]**: the integer group ring of the phase circle;
  a record's rows at a Node are an element of it, one integer weight per
  phase. **The merge** is its addition, with the cancel [p + N/2] = -[p] on
  a record's rows (an antiphase row subtracts), the normal form
  `NatureBeamStore.merge`; the owning statement is
  [DERIVATIONS_BEAM.md](DERIVATIONS_BEAM.md) section 1, operation (G), and
  [BEAM_LAW note 37](BEAM_LAW.md#10-implementation-notes-2026-09-19-the-implementation).

### 1.6 The translation group of the torus

Z_X x Z_Y x Z_Z per world: the GameBoard's extents per axis, each factor
a circle (a periodic axis) or a segment (an open axis whose faces are
the border, a click at the face detector). Chosen per world by `shape`
and `boundary` ([FULL_PICTURE.md](FULL_PICTURE.md) section 1, choice 3;
[ENGINE.md](ENGINE.md), the world file). The translation (T) of
DERIVATIONS_BEAM's list is the action of this group on Nodes, and on the
counts the same division with the remainder kept.

## 2. The ring and the six operations as maps, in symbols

**The one central formula.** The law is one map **F** (the interval's
map) applied at every Node of the GameBoard at every interval, per
component s of the state vector **s**, each with its own rate r and wall
d (the paper's equation (map); [DERIVATIONS_BEAM.md](DERIVATIONS_BEAM.md)
section 0, Eq. (1); the code `core.integer.by_drive`):

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   s <- s + r;      e <- sign(s) x min(floor(abs(s) / d), a);      s <- s - e d      |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Each component of the state is a bounded integer accumulator with a
declared rate and a declared wall: it is translated by its rate,
counted in walls (capped at a = 1 for the drive, uncapped elsewhere,
a = 0 meaning the whole part), and reduced by the walls it holds; every
wall counted is an event (a Link crossed, a phase step taken, a count
completed, a birth, a push) and nothing else happens. The rates and
walls are made of six integer operations and nothing else, the six
verbs of [Highlights 5.4](HIGHLIGHTS.md) (records 181 and 202): (T) the
translation, (B) the bilinear form with a declared matrix, (G) the
group-ring addition, (P) the permutation, (E) the evaluation, (D) the
division with the remainder kept and the comparison. The letters are
DERIVATIONS_BEAM's and the paper's (the Boss's word of 2026-09-23 on
the plan's K14); [COUPLINGS.md](designs/couplings_algebra/COUPLINGS.md)
writes the group-ring addition as A, the same operation. A matrix is
written bold uppercase (**G** the Gram matrix, **E** the tables'
matrix); a verb's tag is plain in parentheses; the same letter never
means both in one sentence. Where the rate is a constant of the world
(the linear block: the flight, the phase, the age, the merge, the
split, the rotation, the evaluation) every component has the closed
form s(t) = floor(s_0 + r t), r the rate as a fraction of the wall, so a
row's state at any time is a formula of its birth and its age; where
the rate is a function of what arrives (the feedback block: the push,
the owed count, the turn, the release, the drive) the map is iterated
and its continuum limit is the differential equation ds / dt = r(s)
(DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 0, "The two blocks"). The read-out is one
comparison, the click (chapter 3).

### 2.1 (T) The translation of an accumulator by its rate

x -> x + r on Z^k or on a torus; every count of the law is this: the
flight on the digital line, the phase's turn, the age, the drive, the
owed count, the release, the lamp's wheel, the push per column. On a
row the flight's accumulator gains 2 S_1 Q per interval against the
wall 2 T_D, started at T_D (the half-wall start), so the Links a row has
crossed by the age tau are

    m_D(tau) = floor((2 tau S_1 Q + T_D) / (2 T_D)),   the k-th Link at tau_k = ceil((2 k - 1) T_D / (2 S_1 Q)),

the flight table's closed form (DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 11.1; the
pace c = Q abs(D)_2 / T_D, chapter 4.2). On a body the drive per axis
gains abs(p_a), the momentum's component, against the wall Q S_w M +
abs(p_a), capped at one Link per interval (a = 1). On the phase, a row
turns phi(tau) = floor((tau + 1) n / d) - floor(tau n / d) steps per
interval of age, the pair [n, d] its family's declaration, read modulo
N; under massive-rows-v1 a massive row turns abs(p_a) N / h steps at
every axis Link over the world's action h (`world.py`, the identity's
paragraph). The translation group of the torus (chapter 1.6) is this
verb on Nodes. Source: DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1 (T), lines 265-273;
section 0.

### 2.2 (B) The bilinear form with a declared matrix

A moment sum over the rows of w x **u**^(x) k of the neighbourhood's
rows (k = 0, 1, 2 and the age: the presence, the flow vector, the
traceless second-moment tensor, the age moment; the one reading a
detector makes), and the coupling **r** = **C** **a** (**C** the coupling
matrix, the reader's charges per column with their declared signs;
**a** the label flow vector of the arriving rows): a signed inner
product over declared columns times the moment (`core.integer.signed_inner`,
"a vector, a declared diagonal matrix of +1 and -1, a vector"). The
push on a body is this form: the rate of its momentum is bilinear in
the state, the reader's content times the flow. The click's weight is
this form on the record's element (2.5): f^T **G** f with **G** =
**E**^T **E**, nothing squared as a step of its own. Source:
DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1 (B), lines 274-277; section 6.7.

### 2.3 (G) The group-ring addition: the merge and the cancel

A record's rows at one Node and label are one element f of Z[Z_N]; the
merge of identical rows is the ring's addition, f <- f + g, with the
cancel [p + N/2] = -[p] on a record's rows (an antiphase row subtracts;
an equal antipodal pair leaves nothing). The cancel identifies x^(N/2)
with -1, so the rows after the cancel are an element of
Z[x] / (x^(N/2) + 1); for N a power of two (64, 1024, 4096, every
registered N) x^(N/2) + 1 is the cyclotomic polynomial of N and this
quotient is the ring of cyclotomic integers Z[zeta_N] itself, a free
Z-module of rank N / 2 on the basis 1, x, ..., x^(N/2 - 1): the
GameBoard's cancel and the click's zero are one relation, exactly (for
an N with an odd factor they are not). Two arms' elements multiply by
the ring's convolution (the pair's product, Bell and GHZ), the label
sum is the ring's addition. Source: DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1 (G),
lines 278-279; section 1.2, the merge's row; section 6.5, lines
1575-1583; section 6.7 (2); chapter 1.5 above.

### 2.4 (P) The permutation of the joint state

The collision: per (Node, number, content) class the single units in
the eight slots are permuted, the forward map the cyclic shift on the
sorted 8-tuples, fixed on the class invariants (the amount and the
labels' sum conserved), the orbits the collision classes (chapter 1;
the group page's section 7); its tie, the sorted order being Port
order, is the one undeclared breaking of the 48. The meeting's turn (an
arc permutation of the direction table, built by comparisons); the gate
(CNOT: the joint labels permuted from the control's bit); the
apportioning's tie (the units left to the largest remainders, ties from
`age mod n`, the tie's start a rotation). A permutation of directions,
labels or Nodes, never of contents. Source: DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1
(P), lines 280-281; section 1.2, the rows of the collision, the
meeting, the gate and the apportioning.

### 2.5 (E) The evaluation at the roots of unity: the click's pointer

The exact evaluation ev: Z[Z_N] -> Z[zeta_N], ev(f) = sum over p of f_p
zeta_N^p, is a surjective ring homomorphism, exactly; its kernel is the
ideal generated by x^(N/2) + 1, which is the merge's cancel of 2.3, so
the first isomorphism theorem holds here exactly: Z[Z_N] / ker(ev) =
Z[zeta_N], the rows modulo the cancel are the cyclotomic integers. It
is also a *-homomorphism for the involution f*(x) = f(x^(-1)) (the
reflection of the phase), carrying f* f, the record's autocorrelation,
to abs(ev f)^2. The built evaluation is the tables C and S at the scale
256 (`core/phase.py`, reduce-and-flip so that C[p + N/2] = -C[p] and
S[p + N/2] = -S[p] exactly): the pointer (X, Y) = **E** f, a Z-linear map
into Z^2 that is NOT a ring homomorphism (at N = 64, **E**(e_1)^2 =
(64400, 12750) against 256 **E**(e_2) = (64256, 12800), COMPUTATION),
whose kernel contains the cancel and is larger than it; the weight is
the norm abs(z)^2 = X^2 + Y^2 = f^T **G** f, one bilinear form (2.2),
and then the ladder on the wheel (2.6). So "one relation, exactly" is
the exact ev, and on the engine it holds within the tables' rounding;
the document states both lines, the exact one as the algebra and the
rounding as the engine's declared constant. Source: DERIVATIONS_BEAM
section 1 (E), lines 282-283; section 6.7, lines 1826-1876;
[the click frame](designs/click_frame/DERIVATION.md) section 9 (2) (a),
lines 1464-1481.

### 2.6 (D) The division with the remainder kept, and the comparison

The count primitive: at each self-creation the accumulator gains its
rate, the count is the whole part it then holds in units of the wall,
that much is subtracted and the remainder stays, bounded below the
wall, its one owner; every wall crossed is the event. **The wording in
force is the code's** (`core.integer.by_drive`, read for the plan's K1
on the Boss's word): the count is abs(s) // d with the sign of the
accumulator, so the division is signed and truncating, the remainder
carries the accumulator's sign in (-d, d), and an accumulator at -1
against the wall 2 counts 0 and keeps -1 (a signed rate, the step
drive, first cancels what it had accumulated the other way); on a
non-negative accumulator (every unsigned count: the owed count, the
release, the lamp, the turn, the push per column, `by_clock`'s floors)
it is the Euclidean division, and there the two wordings agree. The
comparison is part of this verb: the ladder's cell 2 T u + T <= 2 N C_k,
an age against a key, a phase against a window, a threshold, itself a
division whose quotient is 0 or 1 and whose remainder is not read
(the paper: "the division with the remainder kept, together with the
comparison that is the event"). The superseded wording: "the Euclidean
division with the remainder kept" without the comparison ([Highlights
5.4](HIGHLIGHTS.md) item 3, record 202; [TERMINOLOGY.md](TERMINOLOGY.md)
"The six verbs"), right on every unsigned count and on the signed drive
only where the accumulator does not change sign; the wording that
matches the code is DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1 (D), lines 266-270 and
284-287, and it is the one in force. No law changes by this: the code
is the law as built. Source: `src/event_universe/core/integer.py`
(`by_drive`, `by_line`, `by_clock`); DERIVATIONS_BEAM section 1 (D);
section 0, "The readout".

### 2.7 What is not one of the six

A root of the state at run time is the seventh verb, not admitted: the
meeting's norm abs(**t**) = isqrt(**t** . **t**) under the key
`meeting`, and the pushed row's pair under the key `optical` (the two
run-time roots [COUPLINGS.md](designs/couplings_algebra/COUPLINGS.md)
section 3 names), each declared by its design and neither a table
formed at load; Lorentz's gamma on a body's own counter and a bond's
contraction by 1 / gamma, which need such a root (DERIVATIONS_BEAM
section 10.4; [FULL_PICTURE.md](FULL_PICTURE.md) "Not reachable by the
six verbs"; Highlights 5.4, the Lorentz A and B line). A rounded
constant multiplying a row in flight (the rotation's tables, the
meeting's `adv`) is a declared rounding at load or a stated limit, not
a verb. No float, no true division, no draw.

### 2.8 The three tests every rule passes

A rule enters the law only if it is generic (one primitive with
declared integers, no family name or kind, the engine branching on no
name), vector (one of the six verbs on the state vector, its rate at
most bilinear in the state, no root, no float, no rounding at run time
beyond the ones declared at load) and local (its own record and the six
neighbouring Nodes, fixed work and storage for a fixed K, nothing kept
at a Node); "generic" means exactly commuting with the 48, made of the
six operations, reading the neighbourhood alone (chapter 1, the road's
item 6). Source: [skills/workflow.md](../skills/workflow.md) "The three
tests of every rule" (record 202); Highlights 5.4 item 4.

### 2.9 The couplings as verbs, by reference

Every rule the atom worlds and the light worlds run is one of the six
verbs on bounded integers or a stated composition of them, with the two
run-time roots of 2.7 as the exceptions: one row per coupling, 31 rows
(the clock's turn T then D; the owed count; the drive T then D with the
cap then P; the turn by momentum; the release; the lamp's birth; the
flight; the one reading B then G; the crossing a comparison; the push
B, T, D, G; the threshold and the window; the click; the face click;
the split P, B, D, T; the collision P; the merge G; the record's gather
G, B, D, E; the contact and the give D, T; the books G), in
[COUPLINGS.md](designs/couplings_algebra/COUPLINGS.md) section 1, its
one-line result in section 3.

### 2.10 The quantities as algebraic objects, by reference

The table "The physical quantities, when each entered, where it lives,
and which of the six verbs act on it" of
[HISTORY.md](designs/algebra_transition/HISTORY.md), fifteen rows, one
line each: the amount on Z; the content M on Z, the non-compact scale,
free; the phase on Z_N; the multiplicity; the age; the number an
identity label, never arithmetic; the momentum vector **p** in Z^3; the
charge as a rational pair; the label flow **a** and the moments, a
reading; the family table the declared input on which no verb acts;
the couplings as integer matrices **C**; the wheel's coordinate u on
Z_W; Born's rule the bilinear form f^T **G** f on an element of Z[Z_N];
the hand and the axis, a pseudoscalar under the 48; the clock's counts.
The dictionary from the algebra to the physics (mass = content,
momentum = the label, and the rest) is chapter 1.2 and is not restated.

### 2.11 The verbs at one interval, in their order

One interval of a record applies, in order, (T) on every accumulator,
(D) whose whole part is the event, (B) at the push and at the click,
(G) and (E) where rows are summed at one Node and where they end, and
(P) at a collision; on a record's state vector (x, D, **p**, tau, f,
acc_drive, acc_push, acc_owed) the lines are the hop, the phase, the
push, the crowd, the split, the sum, the click and the age, each one of
the six on bounded integers; the identity W = E'_0^2 + 3 **p** . **p**
(chapter 5.3) is not a line of the step but the step's invariant under
covariant-readings-v1. Source: the click frame section 9 (I), lines
1261-1290.

## 3. The click-to-click algebra and the reading rule

### 3.1 The two worlds, and the click as an action

Inside is the GameBoard: Nodes on the cubic lattice, integer rows on
them, and the tick, the interval's count, which no detector ever reads;
where no one measures. Outside is the game above the board: detectors
and their clicks only, which is not reality but is claimed to represent
it, the match shown result by result (Highlights 5.4 item 8, record
762). A detector D at a Node has its own count n_D, its count of
intervals stretched by what arrives at it (the age wall's member at
coefficient 1); it never reads the tick, only n_D. **A click is an
action, not a passive read** (the owner's word of 2026-09-23, record
1139, the Boss's reading; P11): the record ends at the detector, its
content enters the detector's own record, and the detector's count
advances; the click is the event of receiving a packet, stamped with
n_D, a triple (the Node, n_D at the arrival, what arrived); a record is
read once by one comparison and deleted: the only read-out, the one
deletion, and the one non-local step (the pair's gather, 3.6). A
click family F_D is the set of clicks of one detector and its six
neighbours, each with its counts and its contents; the counts of one
detector add, so a click family is a free abelian monoid of counts
whose ratios lie in Q. Source: the click frame section 0
"Definitions", lines 18-39; section 1, lines 244-270; section 9 (1),
lines 1440-1456.

### 3.2 The reading rule, one sentence; the kinds

**A click at a detector, a count between clicks on the detector's own
record, and a ratio of such counts are what is compared with nature;
nothing measured inside the board is compared; a reading of the board
itself is a diagnostic** (the owner's central idea, [record 1104](LOG_2026-09-20.md);
the paper's abstract, record 1115; P11: only a detector's reading is a
measurement, a click, a record's moments or an external thing's reading
as the world file declares). The wordings of the sources agree on this
sentence and add to it in three places, each kept as its record: the
click frame reads "a ratio or a difference of counts at a click, never
the tick" (a difference of counts being a count between clicks);
[Light Outside](designs/light_outside/DERIVATION.md) adds that every
Outside formula carries its own transformation, from the emitter's
clicks at its place to the detector's clicks at its place, and a
reading at another place is a detector at that place (Highlights 5.4,
the owner's word of 2026-09-22); the paper's P11 lists the readings admitted. The
five kinds: DETECTOR, GAMEBOARD, COMPUTATION, HOST, CONVERSION, as the
head of this file defines them (the FAIL rows file, `docs/designs/fail_rows/WHAT_IS_MISSING.md` on the
branch `fail-rows` until it merges, and [Newton from the clicks](designs/newton_clicks/NEWTON_FROM_CLICKS.md)
section 6, the same five).

**The kind of a body's own record (the reading in force, pending the
owner's one line; the Boss's reading of 2026-09-23 on records 991, 1046
and 1139).** A body's own record (its momentum, its place, its `become`
at a count of its own clock) is GAMEBOARD and enters no comparison; a
body that carries a detector's count under the world key `clock_stamp`
is DETECTOR for that count alone (the moving detector with mass, chapter
5.6); Highlights 5.4 item 9's "a body's own record" among the DETECTOR
kinds ("DETECTOR: a click, a record's moments, a body's own record, an
external thing's reading") is the earlier wording, refined by record
991 (the reviewer's read J: "the body's own give rows and count are the
host's view of a store, GAMEBOARD by record 281's words; the DETECTOR
level is the faces'") and by record 1046 (no GAMEBOARD reading, a
body's own record among them, is an input to Newton's chain). The
Newton files and the FAIL rows file use the refined wording (a body's
own record under GAMEBOARD); this file follows it, and the Boss puts
the one line to the owner (the plan's K6).

### 3.3 The count ratios: the two one-way factors and the place-to-place factor

Names (the click frame's, the convention of this file; the plan's K7):
A the detector at rest at Node 0, in no crowd, its own count per
interval 1; B the moving record on an axis, v = 1 / k Nodes per interval
(k a whole number of intervals per hop, the hop pattern x_B(t) =
floor(t / k)), its own count per interval r, a rational n_r / d_r kept
by an accumulator with its remainder, to be found or measured, never
assumed; T the number of a detector's own counts between two records
it emits; k_AB is B's own count between two arrivals of A's records,
over T; k_BA is A's own count between two arrivals of B's records, over
T. Every k is a ratio of two counts of one detector, hence DETECTOR;
every tick is GAMEBOARD arithmetic the reader never sees. On the law,
exactly in the mean (rung 1 on the counts, the remainder below one hop
and one count, the accumulator's carry never accumulating),

    k_AB = r / (1 - v),        k_BA = (1 + v) / r,

and their ratio k_BA / k_AB = (1 - v^2) / r^2. ([Light Outside](designs/light_outside/DERIVATION.md)
section 0 writes the same two factors with the subscripts in the
emitter-to-detector order, so that its k_AB is this file's k_BA; the
record's convention, named once here.) The general form, Theorem 1 of
[Einstein Outside](designs/einstein_outside/DERIVATION.md) (the
place-to-place factor), under (A1), (A3) and the reading by clicks: for
X moving at **v**_X and Y at **v**_Y (Nodes per interval, both below c),
**s** the unit vector from X's Node at the emission to Y's Node at the
arrival, r_X and r_Y the two records' own counts per interval,

    k_XY = (r_Y / r_X) x (1 - s . v_X) / (1 - s . v_Y)        (c = 1; in general s . v / c),

exactly in the mean on an axis (rung 1) and as the instantaneous limit
where **s** turns (rung 2). Its corollaries: X at rest and Y receding
gives k = r_Y / (1 - v), Y at rest and X receding gives k = (1 + v) /
r_X; the round trip k_XY k_YX is r-free for every pair of rates; the
transverse factor is 1 / r_X; two records at rest in crowds give k_XY =
(1 + k_crowd,X) / (1 + k_crowd,Y); the composition k_XZ = k_XY k_YZ
exactly, and by (A3) the chain through Y is the only way a packet
reaches Z from X through Y. The one fact the theorems share: a ratio
of two counts of ONE detector is r-free (the round trip, a radar
velocity, a radar angle); a ratio of counts of TWO detectors carries
r_Y / r_X (a one-way Doppler factor, a rate, an energy). Source: the
click frame section 1 and section 2 (a), lines 244-293; Einstein
Outside Theorem 1, lines 355-397, and lines 466-469.

### 3.4 Locality Outside and discreteness Outside, two theorems; the one assumption beyond them

**Locality Outside** (a theorem of (A1) with the definition of Outside,
P6, nothing leaves the board but clicks): every Outside event is a
click, every click moves information one Node at most, so every
Outside passage is a chain of neighbour steps between neighbouring
places, and the Outside inherits the Inside's locality through the
conversion; it forbids a reading that would need a jump, a velocity
above one Node per interval of the tick, which in a detector's own
count is 1 / r_D Nodes per count (so light in a crowd reads its c in
the detector's stretched count and not above it, series T's clocks,
r_D = 1 / 2.65 at 3 Links, DETECTOR), and a detector reading at a
place no chain of clicks reaches; the one exception is the pair's
click, one gather of one record from both settings, the law's one
non-local operation. **Discreteness Outside** (the quantum of the
Outside step, a theorem of (A1) and the conversion; Theorem 3 of
Einstein Outside; M3, the counts' ratios over Q): (i) the least
separation of two places read is one Link; (ii) the least time a
detector times by itself is a pulse to its neighbour and its return,
two intervals Inside, two of its counts at r_D = 1 (2 r_D in general,
which is how r shows); the tick itself is GAMEBOARD and never read;
(iii) the least step of a moving record is one Node per k counts, so
the Outside velocities are the ratios 1 / k, a ratio of two whole
counts, never a real number, with the velocity quantum

    1 / k - 1 / (k + 1) = 1 / (k (k + 1)),   finest near c and coarsest near rest,

and (iv) c Outside is one Link per the least count, the bound of (iii)
at k = 1, Einstein's second postulate in the click language; the
Outside step of a transponding record in these quanta is place_(j+1) -
place_j = e_j **D**_hat with e_j in {0, 1} and count_(j+1) - count_j = 1
+ owed_j in the detector's own count; read at a distance the count
between two clicks is multiplied by the factors of 3.3, with r the one
quantity of the step above that (A1) leaves free: r = 1 on the law,
sqrt(1 - v^2) up to m^2 v^2 under (A2). The continuum's formulas cannot
say why the world above is quantized; the Inside gives it. **The one
assumption beyond these two theorems**, stated as an assumption and not
a theorem (the owner's word of 2026-09-22, "the basis is Inside, and we
are operated Outside, by emitters and clicks"): its first half, that
every Outside passage is Inside's passage read by clicks, is (A1) with
the definition of Outside; its second half, that we are built of clicks,
that the emitters and the detectors are themselves records of the board
and not a second kind of thing, is MORE than (A1): it is the statement
that the apparatus is inside the law, which the law today does not
carry (a detector, a lamp and an external body are declarations of the
world file, not records that hop), an assumption about the world or a
programme for the law. Source: the click frame section 0, lines 53-95;
section 9 (III), lines 1320-1398, and the closing theorem, lines
1452-1456; Einstein Outside Theorem 3, lines 524-566.

### 3.5 The conversion as a map, in the algebra's own words

The conversion Phi: Inside -> Outside is a composite of four maps, each
with a name in the algebra, the composite with none: on the amplitude,
Outside = rung o (chi_1 of f* f) o ev on the record's element of
Z[Z_N] (a ring homomorphism, 2.5; a pure state's square, the click's
weight R(f) = abs(ev f)^2 = chi_1(f* f), chi_1 the first character of
the commutative *-algebra C[Z_N], a positive quadratic form on the
lattice; a threshold, the rung); on the schedule, Outside = (Nodes
apart) / (counts apart) in Q, on which the Lorentz group up to scale
acts (chapter 5.1); both sides read at the detector's own count. The
names that fit, exactly, in a limit, or not at all (the click frame's
table): a ring homomorphism with a kernel, the first isomorphism
theorem, EXACTLY for ev at the exact root, on the tables within their
rounding; a positive quadratic form on a lattice, EXACTLY (the lattice
Gleason, chapter 4.8: forced in form, free in its Galois constants, c_1
= 1 Born); a state on a *-algebra with the GNS construction, EXACTLY
for Born at one arm at the exact root; a stochastic map (a Markov
kernel), EXACTLY within 1 / N as a frequency law over one deterministic
wheel, not a random draw; a group action of the Lorentz group up to
scale, EXACTLY over Q on the click families and IN THE LIMIT on the
amplitudes; "Outside is Inside modulo a kernel" for the whole
conversion, DOES NOT FIT (the composite is quadratic then thresholded;
what no click reads, the tick, the ordering, the remainders, the scale
r, the phase's origin, is a set of invariances and unread coordinates,
not an ideal); a functor between two categories, DOES NOT FIT. The
conversion table (nine Inside formulas, their Outside readings, the map

### 3.6 The pair: the record of tensor rank 2, the settings, the one gather

A lamp releases one record with two arms and two joint labels, 00 and
11, of weight 1 each: in the lattice's algebra the record is psi = (00)
+ (11) in Z^2 (x) Z^2 (the arms' label spaces), tensored with its phase
in Z[Z_N]; entangled by construction (the coefficient matrix the
identity, of rank 2; no integer vectors **u**, **v** give **u** (x) **v**
= psi); in flight each arm's row moves on its own line with its phase
turned per Link, the weights carried unchanged, nothing of one arm
written on the other (B1). A detector's setting is the integer s of its
`phase_window`; at the detector the arm's label pair is rotated by the
integer matrix **U**_s = [[C'[s], S'[s]], [-S'[s], C'[s]]], C' and S'
the half-angle tables at 1 / 256, with **U**_s^T **U**_s = n_s **I**
exactly, n_s = C'[s]^2 + S'[s]^2 (B2, rule R, verb (B)). The click of a
pair is one gather of the one record from both settings at the
completion interval (P6): the joint pointer J(o_A, o_B) = sum over the
labels l of U_a[o_A][l] U_b[o_B][l], the cell's weight R = J^2, the
birth wheel's u selecting one of the four cells through the rung (B3);
assumed of the world and not supplied by the law: the settings chosen
freely of the record, and the reading the click with c_1 = 1 (B4, P10);
no Hilbert space is assumed. The non-locality sits in one object, the
pair's record of tensor rank 2, carried by local verbs on two arms and
read by one gather at two clicks; the law has the textbook's structure
with Z in place of C, its one departure the rung. What follows exactly
(the marginals, the finite-N Bell value) is chapter 4.9 and 4.10.
