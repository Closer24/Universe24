# Shared agent workflow

These skills implement the project roles requested in issue #16. They are
repository instructions, not a background service or a grant of permissions.
Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) from the current checkout first. Explicit user
instructions take precedence; the postulates, definitions and feature procedure
remain the authoritative physical contracts. Skills route work without copying
or weakening those contracts.

## Inputs and handoff

Give each owner a bounded task with the repository, base commit, candidate/model,
acceptance target and owned files. Include relevant earlier findings and the
current user's constraints. Use isolated branches/worktrees for concurrent edits;
one owner writes each shared interface until the coordinator reconciles changes.

Return a concise handoff with:

- status: pass, blocked or incomplete; distinguish code checks from physical acceptance;
- reviewed commit/tree, changed files, and any dependent branch;
- result and evidence: commands with outcomes, not-run checks, and relevant HTML/trace;
- violated or satisfied contract, remaining limitation, and next owner/action.

Do not reuse a pass after its relevant inputs change without assessing the diff.
An unchanged tree can reuse its verified results; record that equality. Different
conversations do not synchronize automatically. Read current GitHub state before
integrating their work, and never overwrite unrelated edits.

## Checks proportional to the change

For a physics-engine behavior change, completion requires physics-rule validation,
necessary tests, an affected simulator run, and regression comparison. Architecture
reviews interface/schema changes; visualization reviews changed output. Reuse the
same run as evidence for several checks when its inputs and assertions match.

Use independent numerical/behavioral expectations and retain boundary cases that
exercise distinct risks. Consolidate identical worlds rather than multiplying
tests. Do not remove a failing requirement, change a frozen source, or turn failure
into an expected pass to achieve a green gate. A candidate's passing tests do not
repair another model's failure or establish a real-world law.

Pure documentation/skill changes need skill/link/language and packaging validation,
not newly invented physical tests. The repository's existing submission and CI
gate still applies. Every world actually executed uses the existing HTML renderer;
diagnostics may reject a run but may not repair physical state.

## Tools and authority

Use the available local Git/Python tools and discover the connected GitHub tools
when needed. Read access does not imply merge authority. Use existing user
authorization for edits, publishing and merges; do not ask again for an already
authorized action. A skill never supplies otherwise missing authorization or
permits bypassing an access control or failed gate. Do not send messages to people
unless the user authorized that communication.

The PR owner records the tested head, current base and relevant results. The
coordinator is the final merge owner for a coordinated task. Skills do not claim
that GitHub enforces a branch protection rule unless it was actually verified.

## Directional flux handoff

For field or motion changes, every role follows Highlights section 3.3.1 and the
concrete contract in [Field definitions](../docs/FIELD_DEFINITIONS.md). Carry this
requirement into specialist assignments and review the implemented law against it.
Field and architecture owners identify local inventories, face transfers, retained
division remainders and explicit sources or sinks. Physics and test owners check
conservation and free-motion directional ratios with independent expectations.
Simulation and visualization owners reuse those runs and keep each field's units,
face values and retained inventory distinguishable. PR review records remaining
failures; a conserved transfer alone does not establish correct self-response,
causality or an emergent gravity law.
